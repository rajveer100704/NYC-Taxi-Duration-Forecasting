# NYC Taxi Duration Forecasting

**Predicting taxi trip durations in NYC using PySpark & MLlib on the full 2016 dataset.**

---

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building scalable machine learning pipelines to predict taxi trip durations in New York City. Leveraging **PySpark** and **MLlib**, the solution handles large datasets efficiently, implements feature engineering, and achieves fast, accurate predictions using distributed computing.

Key highlights:
- Large-scale dataset processing (1-year NYC taxi trips, 2016)
- Feature engineering including pickup/dropoff location, distance, time, and trip-specific features
- Scalable ML pipelines using PySpark MLlib (Regression models)
- Model evaluation and performance optimization
- Resume-ready showcase of **Big Data, PySpark, MLlib, and Predictive Modeling skills**
